# CapStats

Personal project.
After spending two/three months learning IOS development I decided I would apply my skills to a tangible project.
CapStats is a simple app that can allow a user to keep personal stats for a game of stats.
My first dive into MVC, IOS dev, Realm, Pods, AutoLayout... etc.
